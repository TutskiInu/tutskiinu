Tutski Inu Protocol
Static Rewarding, Liquidity Pool Creation, Manual Burn

We follow DeFi's more popular ones day by day. Bumiz donate an ad to be sent to charity. For example, the promise of High-Interest returns causes token hunters' LP farming trap and ends with dreams for this journey. Discounts related to discounts on promotions with higher stakes before them, oriented to Annual  Interest.  The  market,  which  inflates  like  a  bubble,  continues  with  a similar collapse and ends with farming.

In order to solve this problem in farming rewards, Tutski Inu adopt "StaticRewards" as "Reflection". 

Tutski Inu Ecosystem
Tutski Inu has 3 main functions:

Reflection + LP gain + Burn on every trade.

20% commission split into two channels:

10% tax is distributed to all token holders.

10% tax is added as BNB sales and 5% is added as a liquidity pair in PANCAKESWAP.
