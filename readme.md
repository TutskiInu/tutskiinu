Tutski Inu Protocol Static Rewarding, Liquidity Pool Creation, Manual Burn

We closely follow DeFi's increasing popularity day by day. During this follow-up, we identified some problems that gave investors hopelessness. For example, the promise of High-Yield returns is luring token hunters into the LP farming trap, and this journey ends in disappointment for investors. Investors oriented towards Annual Interest returns are ending their processes at a loss because of buyers with higher stakes before them. The market, which inflates like a bubble, continues with a similar collapse and farming ends in inevitable loss.

To solve this problem for Farming rewards, Tutski Inu adopts "Static Reward", also known as "Mirror".
