Tutski Inu Protocol Static Rewarding, Liquidity Pool Creation, Manual Burn

We follow DeFi's more popular ones day by day. During this follow-up, we identified some problems that gave investors hopelessness. For example, the promise of High-Interest returns causes token hunters' LP farming trap and ends with dreams for this journey. Discounts related to discounts on promotions with higher stakes before them, oriented to Annual Interest. The market, which inflates like a bubble, continues with a similar collapse and ends with farming.

In order to solve this problem in farming rewards, Tutski Inu adopt "StaticRewards" as "Reflection". Automatic Liquidity Pool (LP) Auto LP is functionalized as one, providing two benefits for the application. One; The contract creates a solid price for both buyers and buyers buying tokens from both sellers. Two; commissions, future income and volatility towards arbitration will be in accordance with small plans.

All these are problems caused by existing DeFi reflections. We are sure that model is a show against the outdated image.
